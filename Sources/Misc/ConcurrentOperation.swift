/// A callback block for ConcurrentOperation instances that allow you to add simple block-based tasks that have asynchronous code. To use, call `finish()` whenever the task you were performing is completed.
public typealias ConcurrentOperationBlock = (_ finish: @escaping (CompletionBlock)) -> Void
/**
 A useful Operation subclass that allows for asynchrnous
 actions to be performed before being marked as completed.

 To use, you sublcass `ConcurrentOperation`, override
 `main()` and call `finish()` whenever you want to mark the
 operation as completed.

 ## Subclassing Example
 ````
 public class SampleOperation : ConcurrentOperation {

    override open func main() {

        //... do some async work.
        async_delay(3) {

            // call when done
            self.finish()
        }
    }
 }
 ````

 For small tasks, may also use the block based approach instead of subclassing:

  ## Block Example
  ````
 let op =  ConcurrentOperation { (finish) in
    async_background {
    // .. do some async work
    // when done, call finish()
        finish()
    }
 }
 queue.addOperation(op)
  ````
 - note: Do not call `super.main()` in your implementation.
